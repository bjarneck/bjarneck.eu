Hello! I am a PhD-researcher in Political Science at the Université libre de Bruxelles (ULB), affiliated with the [CEVIPOL research centre](https://cevipol.phisoc.ulb.be/en/about). Previously, I studied at the University of Groningen (BA), the University of Maastricht (MSc), and the University of Cologne (MA).

In my dissertation, I study how the election period shapes affective polarization, and how electoral behaviour in turn is influenced by affective polarization. More broadly, my research focuses on political behaviour, elections, and European politics. I am also very interested in attitudes toward European integration and foreign policy. 

My PhD-project is situated within the inter-university [NotLikeUs project](https://notlikeus.be) and is funded by a 4-year doctoral grant of the [FNRS](https://www.frs-fnrs.be/en/). Feel free to [reach out](mailto:bjarn.eck@ulb.be). if you are interested in my research.
