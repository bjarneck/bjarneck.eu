Hello! I am a PhD-researcher in Political Science at the Université libre de Bruxelles (ULB), affiliated with the [CEVIPOL research centre](https://cevipol.phisoc.ulb.be/en/about). Previously, I studied at the University of Groningen (BA), the University of Maastricht (MSc), and the University of Cologne (MA).

In my dissertation, I study how the election period shapes affective polarization, and how electoral behaviour in turn is influenced by affective polarization. My PhD-project is situated within the inter-university [NotLikeUs project](https://notlikeus.be) and is funded by a 4-year doctoral grant of the Wallon Fund for Scientific Research [(F.R.S.–FNRS)](https://www.frs-fnrs.be/en/). 

More broadly, my research focuses on political behaviour, elections, and European politics. I am also very interested in attitudes toward European integration and foreign policy. Feel free to [reach out](mailto:bjarn.eck@ulb.be) if you are interested in my research.
